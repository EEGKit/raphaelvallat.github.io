          <h3>Compute the average bandpower of an EEG signal</h3>
          <p>May 2018</p>
        </header>

        <p align="justify">Welcome to this first tutorial on EEG signal processing in Python!
          <br><br>We are going to see how to compute the <b>average power of a signal in a specific frequency range</b>, using both <b>Welch and the multitaper spectral estimation methods</b>. This tutorial is mainly geared for neuroscientists /
          sleep
          researchers with some basic knowledge of EEG signal processing.</p>

        <hr />

        <h4>Foreword</h4>

        <p align="justify">One of the most widely used method to analyze EEG data is to decompose the signal into functionally distinct frequency bands, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_wave" target="_blank">delta</a> (0.5–4 Hz),
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_wave" target="_blank">theta</a> (4–8 Hz), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_wave" target="_blank">alpha</a> (8–12 Hz), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_wave" target="_blank">beta</a>
          (12–30 Hz), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_wave" target="_blank">gamma</a> (30–100 Hz).
          <p>

            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/tutorials/bandpower/brain_waves.png" alt="Brain waves" /></span>

            <p align="justify">This implies the decomposition of the EEG signal into frequency components, which is commonly achieved through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" target="_blank">Fourier transforms</a>. The
              almost invariably used algorithm
              to compute the Fourier transform (and arguably the most important signal processing algorithm) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform" target="_blank">Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</a>, which returns, for
              each frequency bin, a complex number from which one can then easily extract the amplitude and phase of the signal at that specific frequency. In spectral analysis, it is then common to take the magnitude-squared of the FFT to obtain an
              estimate of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density" target="_blank">power spectral density</a> (or power spectrum, or <b>periodogram</b>), expressed in (micro)-Volts<sup>2</sup> per Hertz in the case of EEG data.</p>

            <ul class="feature-icons">
              <li class="fa-book">If the previous paragraph is completely obscure for you, I recommand checking out this <a href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-interactive-guide-to-the-fourier-transform/" target="_blank">blog post</a> or
                this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY" target="_blank">video</a> on the Fourier Transform before going further!</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="justify">Although a myriad of analyses can be performed from the power spectral density, I am going to focus here on a very simple one: the <b>average band power</b>, which consists in computing a single number that summarizes
              the contribution of the given frequency band to the overall power of the signal. This could be particularly useful in a machine-learning approach, when often you will want to extract some keys features from your data (and have a single
              number that could summarize a particular aspect of your data).
              <br><br>The average bandpower is also a very relevant metric for sleep research because it allows to differentiate between the different sleep stages. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-wave_sleep"
                target-"_blank">deep sleep</a> is characterized by its predominance of slow-waves with a frequency range comprised between 0.5 to 4 Hz (i.e. delta band), which reflects a synchronized brain activity. Conversely, wakefulness is
              characterized by very little delta activity and much more higher-frequencies activity. Therefore, if you were to compute the delta bandpower for both deep sleep and wakefulness, the former would be very high and the latter very low.
              See for yourself below:
            </p>

            <p align="justify">Time to open your favorite Python editor! If you are new to Python, I strongly recommand using <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab" target="_blank">Jupyter Lab</a>. Loading the data is fairly easy:</p>

            <hr />

            <h4>Computing the power spectral density</h4>

            <p align="justify">In order to compute the average bandpower in the delta band, we first need to compute an estimate of the power spectral density. The most widely-used method to do that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_method"
                target="_blank">Welch's periodogram</a>, which consists in averaging consecutive Fourier transform of small windows of the signal, with or without overlapping.

              <br><br>The Welch's method improves the accuracy of the classic periodogram. The reason is simple: EEG data are always time-varying, meaning that if you look at a 30 seconds of EEG data, it is very (very) unlikely that the signal
              will looks like a perfect sum
              of pure sines. Rather, the spectral content of the EEG changes over time, constantly modified by the neuronal activity at play under the scalp. Problem is, to return a true spectral estimate, a classic periodogram requires
              the spectral content of the signal to be stationnary (i.e. time-unvarying) over the time period considered. Because it is never the case, the periodogram is generally biased and contains way too much variance (see the end of this
              tutorial).
              By averaging the periodograms obtained over short segments of the windows, the Welch's method allows to drastically reduce this variance. This comes at the cost, however, of a lower frequency resolution.

              Indeed, the frequency resolution is defined by:

              $$F_{res} = \frac{F_s}{N} = \frac{F_s}{F_st} = \frac{1}{t}$$

              where \(F_s\) is the sampling frequency of the signal, \(N\) the total number of samples and \(t\) the duration, in seconds, of the signal.

              In other words, if we were to use the full length of our data (30 seconds), our final frequency resolution would be \(1 / 30 = 0.033\) Hz, which is 30 frequency bins per Hertz.
              By using a 4-second sliding window, we reduce this frequency resolution to 4 frequency bins per Hertz, i.e. each step represents 0.25 Hz.

              <br><br>
              How do we define the optimal window duration then? A commonly used approach is to take a window sufficiently long to encompasses at least two full cycles of the lowest frequency of interest. In our case, our lowest frequency of
              interest is 0.5 Hz so we will choose a window of \(2 / 0.5 = 4\) seconds.
            </p>


            <ul class="feature-icons">
              <li class="fa-exclamation-triangle">Another conclusion from the equation above is that <b>the only thing that increases frequency resolution is time</b>. Changes in sampling frequency do not increase the frequency resolution but only
                the frequency coverage. Read more on this <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-sampling-rate-influence-the-frequency-resolution-in-frequency-spectrum-in-FFT" target="_blank">here</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <pre><code class="python">from scipy import signal

# Define window length (4 seconds)
win = 4 * sf
freqs, psd = signal.welch(data, sf, nperseg=win)

# Plot the power spectrum
sns.set(font_scale=1.2, style='white')
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(freqs, psd, color='k', lw=2)
plt.xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
plt.ylabel('Power spectral density (V^2 / Hz)')

            <p align="justify">The <code>freqs</code> vector contains the x-axis (frequency bins) and the <code>psd</code> vector contains the y-axis (power spectral density). The units of the power spectral density, when working with EEG data, is
              usually micro-Volts-squared per Hz (\(uV^2 / H_z\)).</p>

            <ul class="feature-icons">
              <li class="fa-exclamation-triangle">Note that the maximum value of the x-axis is always half the sampling frequency, which is exactly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency" target="_blank">Nyquist frequency</a>.
                This is where the notion of frequency coverage comes into play: if our signal was sampled at 200 Hz instead of 100 Hz, the maximum value on the x-axis would be 200 / 2 = 100 Hz instead of 50 Hz.
                In other words, <b>increasing the sampling frequency results in a larger frequency range</b>.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />

            <h4>Defining the delta band</h4>

            <p align="justify">Now, before computing the average delta bandpower, we need to find the frequency bins that intersect the delta frequency range.</p>
<pre><code class="python"># Define delta lower and upper limits
low, high = 0.5, 4

# Find intersecting values in frequency vector
idx_delta = np.logical_and(freqs >= low, freqs <= high)

                    <span class="image fit"><img src="images/tutorials/bandpower/psd_area.png" alt="" /></span>


                    <hr />

                    <h4>Average band power</h4>

                    <p align="justify">The absolute delta power is equal to the blue area of the previous plot. As there is no closed-form formula to integrate this area, we need to approximate it. This is commonly achieved using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule"
                        target="_blank">composite Simpson's rule</a>. The idea behind it is actually very simple: we decompose this area into several parabola and then sum the area of these parabola. Note that this could also be done using trapezoid
                      (trapezoid
                      rule) or rectangle (as in the Matlab <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/bandpower.html" target="_blank">bandpower</a> function), but parabola typically give <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/44915647/10581531"
                        target="_blank">better estimates</a>.</p>

                    <pre><code class="python">from scipy.integrate import simps

# Frequency resolution
freq_res = freqs[1] - freqs[0]  # = 1 / 4 = 0.25

# Compute the absolute power by approximating the area under the curve
delta_power = simps(psd[idx_delta], dx=freq_res)
print('Absolute delta power: %.3f uV^2' % delta_power)
</code></pre>

                    <blockquote><b>Absolute delta power:</b> 321.064 uV^2</blockquote>

                    <h5>Relative power</h5>

                    <p align="justify">In practice, rather than reporting the absolute band power, one may want to express the power in a frequency band as a percentage of the total power of the signal. This is called the relative band power. It can
                      be calculated very easily
                      from the above:
                    </p>

                    <pre><code class="python"># Relative delta power (expressed as a percentage of total power)
total_power = simps(psd, dx=freq_res)
delta_rel_power = delta_power / total_power
print('Relative delta power: %.3f' % delta_rel_power)
</code></pre>

                    <blockquote><b>Relative delta power:</b> 0.787</blockquote>

                    <p align="justify">In other words, 78.7% of the total power of the signal is contained in the delta frequency band.</p>

                    <hr />

                    <h4>Generalization</h4>

                    <p align="justify">The function below is a generalization of the above which can be used to easily get the average absolute or relative power in a specific frequency band. It is very similar to the Matlab <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/bandpower.html"
                        target="_blank">bandpower</a> function, with the exceptions that it uses a Welch's periodogram instead of a classical periodogram, and it approximates the area using parabola instead of rectangles.

                    <p align="justify">It is also very common to report the ratios between two frequency bands. For instance, the delta / beta ratio is a well-known index of slow-wave sleep quality. When computing ratios between two bands, it is
                      important to control that the
                      window length of the periodogram is the same for the two bands. Indeed, if you are using a different window length for the two bands, this will result in two different periodograms and the ratio will therefore be meaningless.</p>

                    <h4>Using the multitaper method</h4>

                    <p align="justify">Multitaper is a spectral analysis method first developed by David J. Thompson in 1982 in order to overcome some of the limitations of the classical spectral estimation techniques. It provides a more robust
                      spectral estimation than the classical
                      and Welch's periodograms, by combining the advantages of the two methods: high frequency resolution and low variance.

                      and sleep medicine could benefit from it. Another source that was useful for me was the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/examples/signal/mw/signal-ex41524780-multitaper-method" target="_blank">Matlab documentation on
                        Multitaper spectral analyses</a>.
                      <br><br>In a nutshell, the multitaper method starts by filtering the original signal with a set of optimal bandpass filter, called Slepian sequences (or DPSS). This filtering is done by convoluting the original signal with the
                      Slepian sequences. Second, a classic
                      periodogram is calculated for each of these new filtered (or "tapered") data and the final spectrum is then obtained by averaging over all the resulting
                      periodogram. The real strength of the multitaper method comes from the fact that the Slepian sequences are orthogonal to all others and therefore the tapered signals provide statistically independent estimates of the underlying
                      spectrum.
                      In other words, each filtered signal will highlight one specific aspect of the spectral content of the signal.</p>

                    <p align="justify">The multitaper is more computationally intensive than other methods. In the example above, the multitaper method was about 300 times slower than the Welch's method. Using 30-sec of data sampled at 100 Hz, the
                      difference in the time of execution was about ~100ms. Now, imagine that you have several hours of data and several channels sampled at 1000 Hz; what was barely perceptible on our 30-sec data could turn into a difference of
                      several hours (e.g. 1 min for Welch, ~5 hours for the multitaper). This is definitely something that you may want to consider when deciding which method to use.
                      <br><br>Second, although the multitaper methods always provide a more robust spectral estimation, I think that choosing which technique one should use depends on the data at hands. For example, if you have clean data acquired on
                      young healthy individuals, there's a good chance that the multitaper spectral estimation will not differ that much from the Welch's estimate. Furthermore, the Welch's method is probably the most used spectral estimation technique to this day
                      and is quite intuitive to understand. By contrast, the multitaper is a relatively new method that is conceptually harder to grasp.
